# Cyclistic Bike Share Program ðŸš²
This project was created as part of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone. I assumed the role of a Junior Data Analyst on the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago. The analysis focuses on understanding user behavior and providing data-driven insights to support marketing strategies and business goals. ðŸ“Š
